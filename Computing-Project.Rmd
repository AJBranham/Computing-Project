# Computing Project

## Analysis of Blue Dye Absorbance

This project seeks to analyze the differences between the measured absorbances of Artificial Blue Dye No.1, Spurilina-derived blue dye, and Natural blue dye from cabbage-infused water.

```{r}
absorbancedata <- read.table(header = TRUE, text = "Absorbance  Wavelength
2.50        375
2.50        405
1.38        475
2.35        495
2.50        525")
```

Generating Table for artificial Blue Dye No.1 Absorbance. Wavelenths measured listed below.

```{r}
absorbancedata$Wavelength
```

Absorbance values for artificial Blue Dye No. 1 listed below.

```{r}
absorbancedata$Absorbance
```

Trial Table No.1

```{r}
table(absorbancedata$Wavelength, absorbancedata$Absorbance)
```

Trial Table No. 2

```{r}
as.data.frame(absorbancedata, row.names = NULL, optional = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
